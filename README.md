My personal website
I will use this as a planning page for myself :)

## Each page will have:
- the Navigation bar, which will ref. all the pages, and will be styled and be consistent (probably) for each page
- a *main* portion (discribed below)
- the footer, which will contain important info. for all the pages, and will be styled and be consistent (probably) for each page

## Mains
Here are the contents of each of the main pages

### Home:
This will be the landing page that my index.html file refers to. I would like to add less imformative and more interactive things here (i.e. js extensive) to make the website more fun and practice/show off js skills.
### About:
General to talk about myself/my background and the website's purpose. I may include things such as:
- intrests
- strengths/weaknesses
- hobbies
- goals
- pictures (of myself)
- *important* information

### Portfolio:
This will be more detailed place for:
- projects and any relavent links, pictures, details.
- work 
- awards/achievements
- education
- maybe additional details (languages, frameworks, software, etc.) 

### Resume:
My official resume, along with downloading capabilities

### Contact:
my contact information, and automated emailing/messaging capabilities :)
